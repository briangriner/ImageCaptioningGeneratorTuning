# ImageCaptioningGeneratorTuning
These scripts are used to test different tuning configurations for tuning the image and language models. You will need to create a directory called 'results' and copy all .csv files created by the 4 series scripts before running script 5. This allows you to test as many models as you wish without having to update script 5. Enjoy!
